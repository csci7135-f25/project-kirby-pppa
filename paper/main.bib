  abstract   = {We study the interaction of the programming construct “new,” which generates statically scoped names, with communication via messages on channels. This interaction is crucial in security protocols, which are the main motivating examples for our work; it also appears in other programming-language contexts.We define the applied pi calculus, a simple, general extension of the pi calculus in which values can be formed from names via the application of built-in functions, subject to equations, and be sent as messages. (In contrast, the pure pi calculus lacks built-in functions; its only messages are atomic names.) We develop semantics and proof techniques for this extended language and apply them in reasoning about security protocols.This article essentially subsumes the conference paper that introduced the applied pi calculus in 2001. It fills gaps, incorporates improvements, and further explains and studies the applied pi calculus. Since 2001, the applied pi calculus has been the basis for much further work, described in many research publications and sometimes embodied in useful software, such as the tool ProVerif, which relies on the applied pi calculus to support the specification and automatic analysis of security protocols. Although this article does not aim to be a complete review of the subject, it benefits from that further work and provides better foundations for some of it. In particular, the applied pi calculus has evolved through its implementation in ProVerif, and the present definition reflects that evolution.},

  abstract = { Symbolic models for security protocol verification were pioneered by Dolev and Yao in their seminal work. Since then, although inspired by the same ideas, many variants of the original model were developed. In particular, a common assumption is that the attacker has complete control over the network and can therefore intercept any message. This assumption has been interpreted in slightly different ways depending on the particular models: either any protocol output is directly routed to the adversary, or communications may be among any two participants, including the attacker – the scheduling between which exact parties the communication happens is left to the attacker. This difference may seem unimportant at first glance and, depending on the verification tools, either one or the other semantics is implemented. We show that, unsurprisingly, they indeed coincide for reachability properties. However, for indistinguishability properties, we prove that these two interpretations lead to incomparable semantics. We also introduce and study a new semantics, where internal communications are allowed but messages are always eavesdropped by the attacker. This new semantics yields strictly stronger equivalence relations. Moreover, we identify two subclasses of protocols for which the three semantics coincide. Finally, we implemented verification of trace equivalence for each of the three semantics in the DeepSec tool and compare their performances on several classical examples. }

  abstract = { In this paper, we consider the problem of verifying anonymity and unlinkability in the symbolic model, where protocols are represented as processes in a variant of the applied pi calculus, notably used in the ProVerif tool. Existing tools and techniques do not allow to verify directly these properties, expressed as behavioral equivalences. We propose a different approach: we design two conditions on protocols which are sufficient to ensure anonymity and unlinkability, and which can then be effectively checked automatically using ProVerif. Our two conditions correspond to two broad classes of attacks on unlinkability, i.e. data and control-flow leaks. This theoretical result is general enough that it applies to a wide class of protocols based on a variety of cryptographic primitives. In particular, using our tool, UKano, we provide the first formal security proofs of protocols such as BAC and PACE (e-passport), Hash-Lock (RFID authentication), etc. Our work has also lead to the discovery of new attacks, including one on the LAK protocol (RFID authentication) which was previously claimed to be unlinkable (in a weak sense). }

                verification of these protocols can detect subtle bugs that compromise these
                protections at design time, but is a challenging task as it involves
                probabilistic reasoning about random sampling, cryptographic primitives, and
                concurrent execution. Existing approaches either reason about symbolic
                models of the protocols that sacrifice precision for automation, or reason
                about more precise computational models that are harder to automate and
                require cryptographic expertise. In this paper we propose a novel approach
                to verifying privacy-preserving protocols that is more precise than symbolic

                direct-style proofs of privacy, as opposed to indirect game-based

                indistinguishability of possible network traces induced by a
                protocol. We ease automation by leveraging insights from the distributed
                systems verification community to create sound synchronous models of
                concurrent protocols. Our verification framework is implemented in F* as a

  abstract = { Observational equivalence allows us to study important security properties such as anonymity. Unfortunately, the difficulty of proving observational equivalence hinders analysis. Blanchet, Abadi \& Fournet simplify its proof by introducing a sufficient condition for observational equivalence, called diff-equivalence, which is a reachability condition that can be proved automatically by ProVerif. However, diff-equivalence is a very strong condition, which often does not hold even if observational equivalence does. In particular, when proving equivalence between processes that contain several parallel components, e.g., P∣Q and P′∣Q′, diff-equivalence requires that P is equivalent to P′ and Q is equivalent to Q′. To relax this constraint, Delaune, Ryan \& Smyth introduced the idea of swapping data between parallel processes P′ and Q′ at synchronisation points, without proving its soundness. We extend their work by formalising the semantics of synchronisation, formalising the definition of swapping, and proving its soundness. We also relax some restrictions they had on the processes to which swapping can be applied. Moreover, we have implemented our results in ProVerif. Hence, we extend the class of equivalences that can be proved automatically. We showcase our results by analysing privacy in election schemes by Fujioka, Okamoto \& Ohta, Lee et al., and Juels, Catalano \& Jakobsson, and in the vehicular ad-hoc network by Freudiger et al. }

Although we have tried to make this tutorial as stand-alone as possible, we assume some familiarity with the notions of secure encryption, zero-knowledge, and secure computation.},

  abstract = {We generate a natural hierarchy of equivalences for asynchronous name-passing process calculi from simple variations on Milner and Sangiorgi's definition of weak barbed bisimulation. The π-calculus, used here, and the join calculus are examples of such calculi. We prove that barbed congruence coincides with Honda and Yoshida's reduction equivalence, and with asynchronous labeled bisimulation when the calculus includes name matching, thus closing those two conjectures. We also show that barbed congruence is coarser when only one barb is tested. For the π-calculus, it becomes a limit bisimulation, whereas for the join calculus, it coincides with both fair testing equivalence and with the weak barbed version of Sjödin and Parrow's coupled simulation.}

  abstract  = {We introduce Adversarial Logic, an extension of Incorrectness Logic [1] with an explicit Dolev-Yao [2] adversary to statically analyze the severity of security vulnerabilities in the under-approximate setting. Adversarial logic is built on the ability to separate logical facts known to the adversary from facts solely known to the program under analysis. This flavor of program incorrectness can be used to analyze software in which error behavior occurs at deeper levels of interaction between the program and its environment, such as subtle cases of information disclosure requiring multiple program executions to be uncovered. We introduce the Oscillating Bit Protocol, an example algorithm where such a vulnerability can be detected using adversarial logic while remaining elusive to other frameworks. We define a flavor of symbolic execution in which the adversary guides the introduction of symbolic variables and the checking of attack assertions. Additionally, we introduce equivalence testing, an under-approximate version of program equivalence only proven on specific program paths and used to extract differences between comparable implementations. We provide a denotational semantics for adversarial logic and prove its soundness, thereby guaranteeing that extracted attack paths are true positives.},

  abstract  = {We consider security properties of cryptographic protocols that can be modeled using the notion of trace equivalence. The notion of equivalence is crucial when specifying privacy-type properties, like anonymity, vote-privacy, and unlinkability.In this paper, we give a calculus that is close to the applied pi calculus and that allows one to capture most existing protocols that rely on classical cryptographic primitives. First, we propose a symbolic semantics for our calculus relying on constraint systems to represent infinite sets of possible traces, and we reduce the decidability of trace equivalence to deciding a notion of symbolic equivalence between sets of constraint systems. Second, we develop an algorithm allowing us to decide whether two sets of constraint systems are in symbolic equivalence or not. Altogether, this yields the first decidability result of trace equivalence for a general class of processes that may involve else branches and/or private channels (for a bounded number of sessions).},
