\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced adversarial equivalence, a general definition of cryptographic protocol equivalence from the perspective of an active symbolic adversary.
Adversarial equivalence is defined with respect to a collecting semantics that captures the interactions and observations the adversary makes with the protocol, as well as the knowledge adversary can learn from interacting with a protocol.
Unlike prior work, our definitions do not treat receiving messages as observable effects and explicitly model adversary derivations, allowing for a more realistic model of adversarial interaction and observation.
Furthermore, the collecting semantics we introduce serve as a foundation upon which abstractions can be explored and proved sound.
Such abstractions may then be used to simplify and automate the verification of adversarial equivalence.
Ultimately, this work is a first step towards reducing the effort required to prove general cryptographic protocol equivalence, such as simulation-style proofs.
