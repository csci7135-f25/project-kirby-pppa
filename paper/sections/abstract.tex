We consider the problem of verifying cryptographic protocol equivalence with respect to a Dolev-Yao adversary.
Verifying protocol equivalence is the key to common cryptographic proof techniques, such as simulation-based proofs.
Unfortunately, existing proof approaches to verify protocol equivalence either require significant manual proof effort or impose restrictions that make them unsuitable for these cryptographic proof techniques.
In this paper, we lay the foundations for reducing verification effort required to prove protocol equivalence in general.
Specifically, we define adversarial equivalence, a general definition of protocol equivalence from the perspective of an active symbolic adversary.
We further provide a collecting semantics for protocols that captures the information an adversary can learn from interacting with a protocol.
These definitions serve as the foundation upon which sound, over-approximate abstractions can be defined to simplify and automate the verification of adversarial equivalence.
